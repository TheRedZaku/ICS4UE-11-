# ICS4UE-11-Culiminating Project
Documents and files for our culminating project
- This project attempts to create a program that encrypts user data into and out of their account while safely storing their data for future use
- Very baseline project design -> will not actually be at industry standard or up to current standards
- Will include a login and user space for the user to enter and exit from their account and add, delete or modify what they have in their storage
- program only includes Atbash Cipher due to time constraints -> mainly having to implement and bug fix after the implementation
- In the future, the error tracking will be more precise, and a possible GUI could be inplemented to make the program more visually approachable for the user
- Includes 3 classes, and 2 text files
- Potentially could have added more, but again, time was really tight
- Side note: it might have been easier to not have encryption as a separate class, as it caused issues in implementation
